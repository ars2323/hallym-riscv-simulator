/* The first screen's circuit board: where every line, pad and bright point
   goes.  A pure function -- no DOM, no timers, no randomness of its own --
   so it can be checked with `node --test` and its output hashed as a golden
   (tests/renderer/startfield.test.ts).  render.ts draws what this returns.

   What makes it read as a board rather than as scattered lines:

   1. Thin lines, wide apart.  The look lives in the ratio of line width to
      grid pitch, not in either number: 1 to 1.5 px on a 22 px pitch is about
      1:15, and at 1:8 the same drawing reads as ribbons.
   2. Every vertex on the grid; segments level, upright or exactly 45 deg.
      A right angle is cut by a straight 6 px chamfer (drawn()), never
      rounded -- a rounded corner is what turns a board into a ribbon.
   3. Traces leave the chip's pins, and the pins sit on the card's measured
      rectangle: the card is the chip (index.ts), so there is no second drawn
      square for the two to disagree about.  The corners of each edge are
      left bare, as a package has them.
   4. Self-avoiding: two traces never cross and never touch.  That is the
      rule a single-sided board obeys.
   5. Three depths, by width and brightness together (LAYERS), and far more
      pads than traces -- most of them joined to nothing.  The small dots are
      half of the texture; without them the field looks empty however many
      lines are in it.
   6. Brightness is in the alphas and in the flares, never in more lines.
      A board that is too dark is not short of traces -- it is short of
      light, and answering it with more lines fills the grid in and loses
      the board.

   Time.  A path's duration is its length over one speed, so a signal moves
   at the same rate everywhere; its own multiplier (0.35x to 3x) is what
   makes neighbouring traces take different times, and its delay is mostly
   how far from the chip it starts.  Those two are what spread the opening
   over seconds instead of landing it all at once.  What is left moving
   afterwards is a looping schedule of pulses, worked out here from the seed
   so that any moment of it can be drawn from the clock alone. */

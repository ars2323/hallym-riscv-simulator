/* The first screen's circuit board.  The only surface a caller uses:

     const field = startfield({ seed: 20261002 });
     container.append(field.root, card);   // the card carries data-startfield-chip
     field.show(true);

   One parameter, and no import of anything outside this folder, so the
   folder can be copied whole into another simulator: there the call is the
   same with its own seed and nothing else changes.  The chip is found by the
   attribute, not passed in, which keeps it at one.

   onFrame() hands the caller the same clock, so whatever it draws of its own
   -- the card's own lights, in this program -- moves with the board instead
   of beside it, and is photographed by the same capture.

   The card is the chip.  Its rectangle is measured on screen and the pins
   are placed on it, so there is never a second drawn square under a floating
   card for the two to disagree about.

   What this file owns: the two canvases, the clock, and which layer is drawn
   when.  The opening runs on delta time -- adding a constant per frame would
   make it 2.8 s at 60 Hz and 1.2 s at 144 Hz.  The board below is drawn
   while it grows and once more when it has, and then not again however long
   the window is left open; the layer above it is cleared and drawn every
   frame, with at most a handful of things on it.  That is the whole cost of
   a settled board.

   Nothing is animated in CSS that does not end.  The one thing on the card
   that keeps moving -- the die frame's slow breath -- is driven from here,
   as --sf-die on the chip, because a CSS animation that never ends is one
   the capture tool cannot photograph (it freezes them) and one the window
   keeps a compositor thread awake for. */

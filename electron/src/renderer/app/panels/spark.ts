/* The signal that runs on from the board into the card: a light that goes
   round a button's border, and one that runs across the product's name.

   Pure arithmetic -- what each of the three is doing at a moment -- so the
   order they are meant to be in can be checked without a window
   (tests/renderer/spark.test.ts).  welcome.ts puts the result on the
   elements as custom properties and the CSS draws it; nothing here touches
   the DOM.

   Two things decided here rather than in CSS, and for the same reason in
   both cases: a CSS animation that loops cannot be photographed (the
   capture tool freezes animations to take a frame) and keeps a compositor
   thread awake for as long as the window is open.  So the phase comes from
   the board's own clock, and the moments come from the board's own seed --
   which is also what makes the card look like part of the board rather than
   like a dialog sitting on it. */
